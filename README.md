# AssignmentSixSecondGo
User Interaction: From Text Field Input to Display in Label

This is Assignment Six, but with fixes since when I tried to open the simulation in my original one,
it continually failed to build, even though the code looked the same to me...

I checked again after I woke up today. The simulation still works thus far, so hopefully it won't have the same problems
as  before!
