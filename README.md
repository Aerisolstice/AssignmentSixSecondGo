# AssignmentSixSecondGo
User Interaction: From Text Field Input to Display in Label

This is Assignment Six, but with fixes since when I tried to open the simulation in my original one,
it continually failed to build, even though the code looked the same to me...

This one looks like it's working for now, but I'll have to check again later in case the issue arises again.
